This phone’s battery lasts all day, and the screen is stunning.
It does what it’s supposed to, nothing more, nothing less.
I regret buying this vacuum, it barely picks up anything.
The packaging was damaged when it arrived, but the product works fine.
Customer service was really rude and unhelpful.
This camera takes great photos, but the build quality feels cheap.
Can’t believe I wasted money on this piece of junk.
Looks okay so far, haven’t used it enough to say more.
Netflix on this tablet is a dream, bright display and loud sound.
My friend liked it, but I haven’t tried it yet.
